# Aurora-To-Do
 How to add a suggestion/TO-Do option!
 
 
 When opening the github page select ISSUES at the top of the page!
 
 This will then take you to the issues page. Click new issue, and take the time to write if its a suggestion/todo item. 
 
 Then describe your item in the description. A staff member will then take the time to look and labelt the item!
 
 
 If you want to suggest something to our github repo? GREAT! Select the fork option and create a fork of the repo we have! Add anything new/different you want to change and then go to our repo and open a pull request
 
 Select your forked repo and it will let us know that you made a github change!
